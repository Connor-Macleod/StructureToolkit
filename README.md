# Structure Toolkit
Always felt Minecraft structures feel a bit samey? Don't have enough tools in vanilla to make them look good?

Introducing Structure Toolkit, or IYS in short.

# Overview
This mod can fix your Minecraft world. Capable of turning any structure into a masterpiece by introducing just a couple structure processors.

First and foremost this mod adds a ton of processors. All aimed at adding variety.

Random in the processors has been rewritten from the ground up. The vanilla randomness breaks when you try to replace the same block twice with the same rarity.
To that end, all randomness can be controlled to be either on the block level, the piece level, or the structure level.
Every processor will have its own random seed adjustment, to prevent 100% overlap.
This finegrained control will allow to decide per processor how big you want its effect to be.

#Building A Structure
What this mod is not about: Helping you actually build your structure. For that, I will point you to the amazing Structure Tutorial Mod, by TelepathicGrunt.

Much of the code in this mod was either written or inspired by him. Be sure to check out his Repurposed Structures Mod
