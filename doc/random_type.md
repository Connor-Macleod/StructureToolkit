#Random Type
Structure Toolkit adds 3 types of randoms. This allows for far more control. It was added to allow part of the structure to be random for each appearance of the structure, but the same across the structure.

##BLOCK
The BLOCK type will use a different seed for every block that is processed. This is the maximum randomness.

##PIECE
The PIECE type is only applicable for multi piece jigsaw structures. In single piece structures, it functions the same as STRUCTURE.

This level of randomness is ideal if you have a bigger structure and want something to happen in one piece, but not in other pieces. For example, a room with the more than 1 spawner spawning the same mobs, or a village road with a patch of identical flowers.

##STRUCTURE
The STRUCTURE type will always result in the same random value, no matter for which block it runs. Perfect for selecting a specific building material from a list. Think building a house with multiple types of wood.
